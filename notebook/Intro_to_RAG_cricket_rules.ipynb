            "THE PREFACE  The game of Cricket has been governed by a series of Codes of Laws for over 270 years. These Codes have been subject to additions and alterations recommended by the governing authorities of the time.  Since its formation in 1787, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has been recognised as the sole authority for drawing up the Code and for all subsequent amendments.  The Club also holds the World copyright.  The basic Laws of Cricket have stood remarkably well the test of time.  It is thought the real reason for this is that cricketers have traditionally been prepared to play in the Spirit of the Game, recognised in the Preamble since 2000, as well as in accordance with the Laws.  The changes made in this 2017 Code reflect views following a global consultation with players, umpires and administrators at all levels of the game, including the International Cricket Council, the sport’s global governing body.  The game has evolved quickly, requiring six Editions of the 2000 Code to be published in only fifteen years.  A new Code was necessary to rationalise these amendments and to list the Laws in a more logical format and order.  The guiding objectives behind the changes, evidenced from the consultation, have been to maintain a fair balance between bat and ball, to make the Laws easier to understand, to safeguard players’ welfare, and to give umpires more mechanisms to address instances of poor behaviour by players. For the first time, the Laws are written in a gender-neutral format, reflecting the rising popularity of the game amongst women and girls.  The MCC Laws of Cricket provide the framework around which all cricket matches are based. Individual leagues and governing bodies then add their own playing regulations on top, amending the Laws to suit the differing needs of, for example, matches in junior cricket, T20 matches and Test matches. In almost all cases, the fundamentals of the game, such as scoring runs and taking wickets, remain unchanged in such regulations.  The Laws contained in this book are correct at the time of its publication but the MCC website (www.lords.org) and Laws of Cricket App provide a digital version which will be updated with any minor changes, if necessary.  Significant dates in the history of the Laws are as follows: 1700 Cricket was recognised as early as this date. 1744 The earliest known Code was drawn up by certain “Noblemen and Gentlemen” who used the Artillery Ground in London. 1755 The Laws were revised by “Several Cricket Clubs, particularly the Star and Garter in Pall Mall”. 1774 A further revision was produced by “a Committee of Noblemen and Gentlemen of Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London at the Star and Garter”. 1786 A further revision was undertaken by a similar body of Noblemen and Gentlemen of Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London. 1788 The first MCC Code of Laws was adopted on 30th May. 1835 A new Code of Laws was approved by the MCC Committee on 19th May. 1884 After consultation with cricket clubs worldwide, important alterations were incorporated in a new version approved at an MCC Special General Meeting on 21st April. \n",

            "1947 A new Code of Laws was approved at an MCC Special General Meeting on 7th May.  The main changes were aimed at achieving clarification and better arrangement of the Laws and their interpretations.   1979 After five editions of the 1947 Code, a further revision was begun in 1974 with the aim being to remove certain anomalies, consolidate various Amendments and Notes, and to achieve greater clarity and simplicity.  The new Code of Laws was approved at an MCC Special General Meeting on 21st November, coming into effect in 1980. 1992 A second edition of the 1980 Code was produced, incorporating all the amendments which were approved during the intervening twelve years. 2000 A new Code of Laws, including a Preamble defining the Spirit of Cricket, was approved on 3rd May, 2000. 2007   MCC established the Laws sub-committee, replacing the Laws Working Party. 2010   A fourth edition of the 2000 Code was published.  MCC members agreed at a Special General Meeting on 5th May that the MCC Committee is entitled to change the Laws of Cricket without seeking the approval of the members. 2017 After six Editions of the 2000 Code, a new 2017 Code came into effect on 1st October, 2017. Many queries on the Laws are sent to MCC for decision every year.  MCC, as the accepted Custodian of the Laws, has always been prepared to answer the queries and to give interpretations.  However, MCC reserves the right not to answer queries which it considers to be frivolous or connected in any way with a bet or wager.  Lord’s Cricket Ground G.W.

            "THE PREAMBLE – THE SPIRIT OF CRICKET  Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. Respect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. Play hard and play fair. Accept the umpire’s decision. Create a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. Show self-discipline, even when things go against you. Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. Cricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket.             The players, umpires and scorers in a game of cricket may be of any gender, and the Laws apply equally. The use, throughout the text, of pronouns expressing a binary he/she is as inclusive as practicable, whilst retaining clarity. Except where specifically stated otherwise, every provision of the Laws is to be read as applying to all persons, regardless of gender.   \n",

            "LAW 1 THE PLAYERS 1.1 Number of players A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. By agreement a match may be played between sides of fewer than, or more than, eleven players, but not more than eleven players may field at any time. If, during the match and for whatever reason, a side is reduced to fewer than the original number of nominated players, the match shall continue as long as it is possible to do so under the Laws or any agreements made before the toss. 1.2 Nomination and replacement of players Each captain shall nominate his/her players in writing to one of the umpires before the toss. No player may be replaced after the nomination without the consent of the opposing captain. 1.3 Captain 1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him/her.  1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as his/her deputy to do so. See 1.2.  1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the duties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Laws, including at the toss. See Law 13.4 (The toss). 1.4 Responsibility of captains The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The Spirit of Cricket as well as within the Laws.  See The Preamble – The Spirit of Cricket and Law 41.1 (Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains).  LAW 2 THE UMPIRES 2.1 Appointment and attendance Before the match, two umpires shall be appointed, one for each end, to control the match as required by the Laws, with absolute impartiality.  The umpires shall be present on the ground and report to the Executive of the ground at least 45 minutes before the scheduled start of each day’s play. 2.2 Change of umpire An umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured or ill.  If there has to be a change of umpire, the replacement shall act only as the striker’s end umpire unless the captains agree that the replacement should take full responsibility as an umpire.  2.3 Consultation with captains Before the toss the umpires shall 2.3.1 meet with the captains; the umpires shall determine 2.3.1.1 the balls to be used during the match.  See Law 4 (The ball). \n",

            "2.3.1.2 the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals.  In a match of one day’s duration, no specific time need be agreed for the tea interval.  It may be agreed instead to take this interval between innings.  See Law 11 (Intervals). 2.3.1.3 which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. 2.3.1.4 the boundary of the field of play and allowances for boundaries, including whether any obstacle within the field of play is to be regarded as a boundary.  See Law 19 (Boundaries). 2.3.1.5 the use of covers. See Law 10 (Covering the pitch). 2.3.1.6 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match.  2.3.2  inform the scorers of agreements in 2.3.1.2, 2.3.1.3, 2.3.1.4 and 2.3.1.6. 2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 2.4.1 the wickets are properly pitched.  See Law 8 (The wickets) 2.4.2 the creases are correctly marked.  See Law 7 (The creases). 2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of Laws 19.1 (Determining the boundary of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). 2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 2.5.1 the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with the Laws. 2.5.2 the implements used in the match conform to the following: 2.5.2.1 Law 4 (The ball). 2.5.2.2 externally visible requirements of Law 5 (The bat) and Appendix B. 2.5.2.3 either Laws 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails) or, if applicable, Law 8.4 (Junior cricket). 2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted.  See Appendix A.2.  Note particularly therein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. 2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of Law 27.2 (Gloves). 2.6 Fair and unfair play The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. 2.7 Fitness for play 2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place.   Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous. \n",

            "2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player or umpire. 2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible for play to proceed. 2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batsmen of the ability to play their strokes or to run between the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable for play to take place. 2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances 2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch.  See Law 6.1 (Area of pitch). 2.8.2 The Umpires shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence, if either umpire considers that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are either dangerous or unreasonable. 2.8.3 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions.  They shall make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials.  Immediately the umpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the players to resume play. 2.9 Position of umpires The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs the captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. 2.10 Umpires changing ends The umpires shall change ends after each side has had one completed innings.  See Law 13.3 (Completed innings). 2.11 Disagreement and dispute Where there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision.  See also Law 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). 2.12 Umpire’s decision An umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly. This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. 2.13 Signals 2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires: 2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play Dead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist.

However, the bowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. 2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before allowing play to proceed. If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \n",

            "2.14 Informing the umpires Throughout the Laws, wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players, it will be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. 2.15 Correctness of scores Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential.  The umpires shall, throughout the match, satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where appropriate, the number of overs bowled.  They shall agree these with the scorers at least at every interval, other than a drinks interval, and at the conclusion of the match.

The umpire shall inform the other umpire and indicate to the batsmen and the scorers whenever a new ball is taken into play. 4.5 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play If, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through normal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball had received before the need for its replacement.

If, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side batting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to win, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs.

See Law 2.15 (Correctness of scores). 16.9 Mistakes in scoring If, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires discover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to 16.10, they shall adopt the following procedure. 16.9.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and either   the number of overs to be bowled in the last hour, or in that innings, has not been completed or    the agreed time for close of play, or for the end of the innings, has not been reached then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. Unless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of overs has been completed and either time for close of play has been reached or the allotted time for the innings has expired, as appropriate.  The number of overs and time remaining shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the supposed conclusion of the match.

See Law 20 (Dead ball).  Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, - replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. - put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. 29.4 Dispensing with bails If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with Law 8.5 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the umpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been put down. 29.4.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his/her clothing or equipment as described in 29.1.1.2, 29.1.1.3 or 29.1.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in 29.1.1.5. 29.4.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, 29.4.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the ground.

However, 30.2.1, 30.2.2, 30.2.3 and 30.2.4 will still apply, but only to the runner and the non-striker, so that that ground will also belong to either the non-striker or the runner, as the case may be. 30.3 Position of non-striker The non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that from which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire.  LAW 31 APPEALS 31.1 Umpire not to give batsman out without an appeal Neither umpire shall give a batsman out, even though he/she may be out under the Laws, unless appealed to by a fielder.  This shall not debar a batsman who is out under any of the Laws from leaving the wicket without an appeal having been made.  Note, however, the provisions of 31.7. 31.2 Batsman dismissed A batsman is dismissed if he/she is either  given out by an umpire, on appeal or  out under any of the Laws and leaves the wicket as in 31.1.  31.3 Timing of appeals \n",

The call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not been called.  See Laws 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). 31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” An appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. 31.5 Answering appeals The striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of Laws 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 (Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end.  The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. When an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his/her jurisdiction. When a batsman has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with 31.3, if it is on a further matter and is within his/her jurisdiction. 31.6 Consultation by umpires Each umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction.  If an umpire is doubtful about any point that the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and shall then give the decision.  If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. 31.7 Batsman leaving the wicket under a misapprehension An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batsman, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a misapprehension of being out.  The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batsman.   A batsman may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. 31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal The captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose jurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision and recall the batsman. The withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the innings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field.

LAW 33 CAUGHT 33.1 Out Caught The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his/her bat without having previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. 33.2 A fair catch 33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case either the ball, at any time or any fielder in contact with the ball,  is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed.  Note Laws 19.4 (Ball grounded beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary).  33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies:   33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the ground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing.   33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it has not been grounded since it was first struck.  See Law 34 (Hit the ball twice). 33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder, a runner or the other batsman.  33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in 33.2.1 are met.  33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the umpires.  33.3 Making a catch The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his/her own movement.  \n",

A7.3 Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side on the field of play. This definition includes not only both the bowler and the wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are legitimately on the field of play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent nominated players.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the field of play, or who has been absent from the field of play and who has not yet obtained the umpire’s permission to return.  A player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his/her duties as a fielder is not absent from the field of play nor, for the purposes of Law 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he/she to be regarded as having left the field of play.    A8 Substitutes, Replacements and Runners A8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but does not replace the player for whom he/she substitutes on that side’s list of nominated players.  A substitute’s activities are limited to fielding. A8.2 A Replacement is a player who takes the place of a nominated player and who, thereby, becomes a nominated player.

If the return crease is on the same side as his/her bowling arm, he/she is bowling round the wicket. A9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he/she normally releases the ball for a delivery. A9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not.  It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  The stride after the delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back foot of the delivery stride lands again.  A10 The ball \n",

A11 Runs A11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in Law should not have been taken.  It is not only to be cancelled but the batsmen are to be returned to their original ends.   A11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a properly executed run.  It is not a run that has been made, so the question of cancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is not a disallowance and the batsmen will not be returned to their original ends on that account.     A12 The person A12.1 Person; A player’s person is his/her physical person (flesh and blood) together with any clothing or legitimate external protective equipment that he/she is wearing except, in the case of a batsman, his/her bat. A hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batsman’s person. No item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him/her. For a batsman, a glove being held but not worn is part of his/her person. For a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he/she is holding in his/her hand or hands is not part of his/her person. A12.2 Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles or jewellery, that is not classed as external protective equipment is classed as clothing, even though he/she may be wearing some items of apparel, which are not visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batsman does not come within this definition of clothing. A12.3 Hand for batsman or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole of a glove worn on the hand.  A13 Off side/on side; in front of / behind the popping crease.  \n",

Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result.
